# KNet roadmap

The roadmap can be synthetized in the following points:

* [X] Add classes to simplify management from .NET:
  * [X] Producer/Conusmer
  * [X] Admin
  
* [X] Create Kafka Connect and Kafka Streams bridging classes for .NET to mix both any JVM language (Scala, Java) and .NET languages;
* [ ] Add features to extend ability to use .NET packages (e.g. EntityFramework) with Kafka Streams.
* [X] Add PowerShell client
