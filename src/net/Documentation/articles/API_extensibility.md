# KafkaBridge: APIs extendibility

What to do if an API was not yet implemented? The simplest answer is: help us to make this product reacher :-)
Anyway there is another answer which is not available with other products: Dynamic code and programmatically API access.

With **JCOBridge** a developer can use some properties to manage objects in the JVM. 
Each KafkaBridge class implemented contains some methods and two properties: a direct and a dynamic accessor able to analyze the JVM class and executes the code.
So it is not necessary at all to have the methods be ready to be used.

## When a method is not available

Let's go with an example of a ready made API available in `KafkaProducer`:

```C#
public void BeginTransaction()
{
	IExecute("beginTransaction");
}
```

This is a void method, using **IExecute** the user of the library can invoke the `BeginTransaction` method on the class. Anyway the developer can invoke the internal method directly from the instance of the object:
```C#
KafkaProducer producer = new KafkaProducer(...);

producer.IExecute("beginTransaction");
```

`beginTransaction` can be replaced with any method (with or without parameters) of the class (`KafkaProducer` was only an example).

## When a class is not available

In a more compex scenario the method can return back objects. We start again from a ready made API:

```C#
public Future<RecordMetadata> Send(ProducerRecord record)
{
	return New<Future<RecordMetadata>>("send", record.Instance);
}
```

in this case the method accept in input a ready made class `ProducerRecord` and returns a ready made `Future<RecordMetadata>`. From a user point of view the C# and Java method behave the same.

### Return class is not available

Now consider that the returned data type (`Future<RecordMetadata>`) is not yet implemented; a solution on this problem is to use directly the `send` Java method like in the following code snippet does:
```C#
KafkaProducer producer = new KafkaProducer(...);
ProducerRecord record = new ProducerRecord(...);
var dynFuture = producer.IExecute("send", record.Instance); // the returned object is a dynamic object reference of the Future object in Java
var dynRecordMetadata = dynFuture.get();  // the returned object is a dynamic object reference of the RecordMetadata object in Java

// then the developer can access any method of the RecordMetadata using dynRecordMetadata

bool hasOffset = dynRecordMetadata.hasOffset();

```

The example above consider the classes `Future` and `RecordMetadata` not implemented yet. Anyway them exists in JVM.

### Input and Return class are not available

If even the input class is not available the solution is like the following:

```C#
KafkaProducer producer = new KafkaProducer(...);
var dynProducerRecord = producer.JVM.New("ProducerRecord", ....); // the returned object is a dynamic object reference of the ProducerRecord object in Java
var dynFuture = producer.IExecute("send", dynProducerRecord); // the returned object is a dynamic object reference of the Future object in Java
var dynRecordMetadata = dynFuture.get();  // the returned object is a dynamic object reference of the RecordMetadata object in Java

// then the developer can access any method of the RecordMetadata using dynRecordMetadata

bool hasOffset = dynRecordMetadata.hasOffset();

```

The example above consider that even the class `ProducerRecord` is not implemented yet. Anyway it exists in JVM.
Each object, like `KafkaProducer` instance, exposes (hidden in the editor) two properties:
* **JVM** which access the JVM using methods;
* **DynJVM** which access the JVM using the Dynamic engine.

Using the properties it is possible to instruct the JVM about the action to be done.

### Anything is not available

If no classes are available the solution comes from the global accessor available in JCOBridge and the code snippet is like the following one:

```C#
var dynKafkaProducer = JCOBridge.Global.JVM.New("KafkaProducer", ...); // the returned object is a dynamic object reference of the KafkaProducer object in Java
var dynProducerRecord = JCOBridge.Global.JVM.New("ProducerRecord", ....); // the returned object is a dynamic object reference of the ProducerRecord object in Java
var dynFuture = dynKafkaProducer.send(dynProducerRecord); // the returned object is a dynamic object reference of the Future object in Java
var dynRecordMetadata = dynFuture.get();  // the returned object is a dynamic object reference of the RecordMetadata object in Java

// then the developer can access any method of the RecordMetadata using dynRecordMetadata

bool hasOffset = dynRecordMetadata.hasOffset();

```

The example above consider that even the class `KafkaProducer` is not implemented yet. Anyway it exists in JVM.
In previous chapter the tutorial reports about two hidden properties in each object; the properties on each class are just an useful reference to the real one available in `JCOBridge.Global`:
* **JVM** which access the JVM using methods;
* **DynJVM** which access the JVM using the Dynamic engine.

Using the properties it is possible to instruct the JVM about the action to be done.

### Call a method dynamically

Look at the simple example below:

```C#

var consumer = new KafkaConsumer<string, string>(props);
var topPart = consumer.JVM.New("TopicPartition", "myTopic", 0); // the returned object is a dynamic object reference of the TopicPartition object in Java
var result = consumer.DynInstance.committed(topPart); // this line invokes dynamically the committed on the instance of the KafkaConsumer
```

The example above consider the class `TopicPartition` not implemented yet. Anyway it exists in JVM.
As exposed before, each object, like `KafkaConsumer` instance, exposes (hidden in the editor) two properties.

Explaining the code:
* The first line creates a JVM object in C# style: `KafkaConsumer` lives in the CLR and has its counterpart in the JVM.
* The second line requests to the JVM to allocate a `TopicPartition` object with two parameters.
* This resulting object (`topPart`) is used in the third line as parameter of the `committed` method invocation.
* The `result` is a **dynamic** object that can be used to extract data or invokes other methods.

## API exendibility limitation

Starting from the assumption that JCOBridge does not make any code injection, or compilation, within JVM side, the actual limitation is related to something missing within the JVM.
In the [JVM callbacks](jvm_callbacks.md) article there is an explanation of how works callbacks.
**The callback feature needs a concrete class in the JVM and if it does not exist there is no way to use it from KafkaBridge.**
