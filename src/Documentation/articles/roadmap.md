# KafkaBridge roadmap

The roadmap can be synthetized in the following points:

* Add more classes to simplify management from .NET:
  * Producer/Conusmer
  * Admin
* Create Kafka Connect and Kafka Streams bridging classes for .NET to mix both any JVM language (Scala, Java) and .NET languages;
* Add features to extend ability to use .NET packages (e.g. EntityFramework) with Kafka Streams.
